                Come experience a morning swim with us and the Dolphins on the beautiful Kona Coast on the Big Island of Hawaii! The Hawaiian Spinner Dolphins are year round residents so you can expect to see them whenever you are in Hawaii…
              </p>
              <p>
                SunLight On Water, with Melainah, Michael and their exceptional staff, offer you the opportunity to have an experience that you will easily remember for the rest of your life &ndash; <a href="<?php echo MOBILE_BASE_URL ?>/dolphin-tours.php">swimming with Dolphins</a> that are wild and free in their natural habitat.
              </p>
              <p>
                There is nothing that compares to the feeling of being in the ocean with the Dolphins! You can see Dolphins on tv, can visit them in captivity, and you can even see them from a boat &ndash; but swimming with them in their natural ocean habitat is a unique and magical experience that can touch you in ways you might not be able to imagine.
              </p>
              <p>
                We’ve been conducting <a href="<?php echo MOBILE_BASE_URL ?>/dolphin-tours.php">Dolphin Swims</a> longer and more successfully than any other Hawaiian <a href="<?php echo MOBILE_BASE_URL ?>/dolphin-tours.php">Dolphin Swim</a> eco-tour operator over 15 years! We have a 99% success rate in finding the Dolphins each day! Equally important is the context within which we offer our tours. Our philosophy is one of total respect for the Dolphins, all marine life and the ocean.
              </p>
              <p>
                When Michael is the morning captain, your journey will start with a Hawaiian ceremony to greet the day, and then it’s off to the adventure of a lifetime &ndash; a morning swim with the Dolphins! Simply put, the experience is transformative, and it’s frankly impossible to fully articulate. Dolphins are amongst the most intelligent beings on the planet and being with them in their own habitat will amaze you. Imagine your excitement as we cruise out to where the Dolphins live and play.
              </p>
             <p>
              As we are making our way along the Kona Coast, relax and let yourself enjoy the feel of 
              the wind and notice how the sun glints off the surface of the Ocean, hence our name, SunLight On 
              Water. Take in the beautiful color of the Ocean as she beckons to you... The setting is 
              perfect...
            </p>
            <p>
              And then you see them-- Spinner Dolphins spinning in the air to greet you! They love to ride 
              the bow wake of our boat. They are sleek and graceful and exude absolute joy.
            </p>
            <p>
              There is nothing like it.
            </p>
            <p>
                After receiving instruction about the proper protocols for entering into the Dolphins' world 
                and receiving some insider tips on how to get the most out of your Dolphin swim, the moment comes 
                when quietly and gently you ease into the water with these incredible Beings and join the Dolphin 
                pod. It is completely safe, and a rewarding experience for the entire family. Children of all ages 
                are welcome. If young children do not choose to go into the Ocean, for their safety, an adult must 
                remain on board with them at all times. There is usually time for parents to take turns going into 
                the Ocean. All you need is your sense of wonder and a willing Spirit.
            </p>
            <p>
              During the winter, there is a good chance you will see Humpback Whales on the way to be with 
              the Dolphins. Other interesting sea life has been known to pay us a visit as well such as Spotted 
              Dolphins, Bottle Nose Dolphins, Whale Sharks, Pilot Whales, Manta Rays, Eagle Rays, the Honu 
              (turtles) among others. Michael may even find an Octopus for you to see!
            </p>
